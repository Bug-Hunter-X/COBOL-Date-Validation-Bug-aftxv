This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs related to date and time validation.  The provided COBOL code snippet shows how a seemingly simple date check can fail for dates beyond the year 9999.  This is due to the limitation of the PIC 9(8) data type which is used to represent the date.  The solution demonstrates a more robust approach that overcomes this limitation.
